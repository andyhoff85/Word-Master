# Word Master

Main.py is my first attempt at programming a word game. It is functional, but lacks a GUI. It can be played in the python console.

Main.JS is in progress. It is my attempt at a JS version of the python game.

## Game Rules

The player will have 7 letters chosen randomly and will always have at least 1 vowel. The player must make as many words as possible within a minute using the random letters. Repeating letters is perfectly fine. Words must be at least 3 characters long. After the round, the game checks the player created words against a dictionary to verify they are legit and discards duplicates.

## Scoring

3 letter words = 5
4 letter words = 10
5 letter words = 25
6 letter words = 50
7 letter words = 100
8 letter words = 250
9+ letter words = 500
